# Softmax
Implementation of softmax classifier on CIFAR-10 dataset


Overview
============

The Softmax classifier consists is implemented in 3 ways:
* Unvectorized Version
* Half - Vectorized Version
* Fully Vectorized Version


Dependencies
============

* Numpy 
* matplotlib
* scipy 
### Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies


Usage
===========

To check the implementation of code, just open softmax.ipynb and run the all the cells
